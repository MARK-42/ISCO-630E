Linear Regression(Group Project)

Download Housing Price Data of Winsor, Canada City. Each group should use 50 dataset out of 550 data. Find Regression Parameters using 
a) Normal Equation + Regularistion
b) Gradient Descent + Regularisation
Write yout conclusion for the project.



Linear Weighted Regression

Use Housing Price Dataset & implement LWR Algorithim. You may take neighbourhood batch size of data around 20. Tune the bandwidth and calculate weight parameters. Compare LWR with regularised GD and Regularised Normal Equation.
