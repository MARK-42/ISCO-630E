# Assignments

The assignment folders contain the description of the assignment statement along with pyhton codes(and dataset).
 
1. Using Naive Baysian Classifier: Predict   where   a   given   mail   is   spam   or   not.   Use   the  data set provided for this purpose. (structured data set).


2. River/Not-River
	1. Using Naive Bayesian classifier predict river non river 	using Satellite data set of Hooghly river (unstructured 	data set). 
	2. Using PCA: Apply PCA on given river/non-river images.

3. Perform Linear Regression on the given housing dataset with regularization. 
Also implement LWR and find out what happens when the value of tau is very small.


4. Perform Face Recognition:
    1. Using PCA : Create face   dataset   using   your   mobile   	phone   for   your  face   as   well   as   faces   of   9 	other   friends.   Create   multiple   variants   (at   	least   5)   of   each  faces with different view angles. 
    2. Using LDA : Create face dataset using your mobile phone 	for your face as well as faces of 9 other friends.Create 	multiple variants (at least 5) of each faces with 	different view angles.

5. Use the microchip dataset . Use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. 
	1.	Use raw data as given, and from there develop a GDA 	model (without Box-Muller transformation).
	2.	For two features, first  using Box- Muller 	transformation create new data set having Gaussian 	distribution within the range of the given  data set and  	create Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)  model.

6. Supervised Artificial Neural Network
	1.	Implement Perceptron training algorithms for AND ,OR, 	NAND and NOR gates. How you will verify your trained 	algorithms? 
	2.	Using two input one output X-NOR data , train a 	Neural Network	using Back Propagation Algorithm.Explain 	how will you test the network.

7. A Bidirectional Associative Memory is used to store given 4 pairs of patterns of setA and setB. Calculate Weight Matrix and test the level of weight corrections.

8. A Kohennen Network is used to classify 2-D i/p vectors. Training is to be done with randomly generated neurons.

9. Design FIS to diagnose whether a person has Covid'19 or not based on symptoms, using both Mamdani and Sugeno Approaches.
